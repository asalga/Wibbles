# Wibbles by Andor
This is a clone of Nibbles (Remember Nibbles.BAS??). Anyway, I wanted to learn a bit about pixi.js and require.js, so I decided to write a simple game that used those js libraries.

The levels are loaded from PNG images. Meta data for the levels can be found in scripts/boardMetaData.js

### Version

### TODO
 - Add events
 - Fix loading textures
 - fix slow input
