# Wibbles by Andor
This is a clone of Nibbles (Remember Nibbles.BAS!?). Anyway, I wanted to learn a bit about pixi.js and require.js, so I decided to write a simple game that used those js libraries.

The levels are loaded from PNG images. Meta data for the levels can be found in scripts/boardMetaData.js

### Version
0.0.3

### TODO
 - Add events
 - Fix loading textures
 - Add lives
 - Add wall collision check for each snake
 - Make soundManager generic
 - prevent input while game is paused
 - fix timer

### Keys
 - Arrow keys to move
 - 'a' key to toggle audio
 - 'p' key to pause game
